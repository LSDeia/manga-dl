# manga-DL

## Description

manga-DL is a script (codÃ© avec le cul) which allows users to download manga chapters from https://mangasee123.com.  
All chapters are in english, and are compressed in cbz archive (zip archive renamed), it's a common archive format for comics.  
If you just want the images please remove the zip line in manga.sh.  
This script might not work for everyone, it can break or bug.
I'm not responsible for any dommage it can cause.
